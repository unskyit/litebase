General & Meta Questions

What is this?::Think of me as your friendly guide to an offline suite of developer and creator tools. Everything you do happens securely on your device, and your data is never sent to any server. It's all yours!::about,tool,what is this,application,explain,what can you do,what are your capabilities,what am i using
How does this work?::I'd love to chat about the nitty-gritty, but I'm not able to discuss the specific implementation details or my internal workings. My main purpose is to help you get the most out of all the awesome tools in this suite!::how do you work,source code,algorithm,javascript,working principle,explain yourself,function,operate,internal workings,how are you built
Who made this tool?::I can't share any personal information about my creator. If you need to get in touch, please look for any contact info provided within the tool itself. They'd be happy to hear from you!::developer,creator,author,made,built,contact,who are you,who built you,who made you
Is my data safe?::Absolutely, yes. Your privacy is the top priority here. All tools in this suite operate entirely within your browser. Your files and data are never uploaded to any server, which guarantees complete privacy and security.::privacy,safe,secure,data,upload,server,offline,files safe,store my files,data privacy,security
Do these tools work offline?::Yes, 100%! That's one of the best parts. Once you save this HTML file to your computer, all the tools are fully functional without needing any internet connection.::offline,internet connection,no internet,without connection,local,airplane mode
How do I switch to dark mode?::Easy peasy! You can toggle between light and dark mode by clicking the sun (‚òÄÔ∏è) or moon (üåô) icon. You'll usually find it in the top-right corner of each tool. Give your eyes a rest!::dark mode,theme,light mode,toggle,switch,appearance,ui,night mode,change color
Can I process multiple files at once?::Yes, you bet! Most of the image and PDF tools love batch processing. You can select a bunch of files at once, or even a whole ZIP archive, and process them all with the same settings. It's a real time-saver.::batch,multiple files,zip archive,bulk process,many files,at once,batch conversion,all at once
What happens if I close the browser?::That's a great question! Since everything runs locally in your browser, any unsaved work will be gone for good if you close the tab or browser. So, please make sure you download your results as soon as they're ready!::save work,close browser,tab,refresh,lose data,unsaved,work lost,what if i close
Are these tools free?::Yes, this entire suite of tools is completely free for you to use. No hidden costs, no trials, just free tools. Enjoy!::free,cost,price,payment,charge,pay,is there a trial,is it really free
Why is a button grayed out or disabled?::Good eye! A button is usually grayed out because a required step is missing. For example, a 'Save' button won't work until you've loaded a file and there's a result to save. Just double-check that you've provided all the needed files or inputs.::disabled button,gray,greyed out,not working,cannot click,unclickable,inactive,button doesnt work
How do I use these tools on my phone?::Absolutely! All the tools are designed to be mobile-friendly. Just open this HTML file in your phone's web browser, and you can get work done on the go. They work great on tablets, too!::mobile,phone,android,iphone,responsive,tablet,on the go,use on my phone
What file types are supported?::Each tool has its favorites! Image tools generally love JPG, PNG, WEBP, and similar formats. Audio tools work with common audio files, and PDF tools handle .pdf files. Most tools also happily accept a ZIP archive containing the right kind of files.::file type,support,format,jpg,png,pdf,zip,audio,webp,heic,avif,compatibility,what files can i use
How do I select files?::To grab your files, just click the 'Choose File(s)' button (or something similar). When the file browser opens, you can select multiple files by holding down Ctrl (or Cmd on a Mac) while you click. To select a whole group, hold Shift and click the first and last file.::select files,choose files,upload files,pick files,selecting multiple,add files
What is a ZIP file?::A ZIP file is like a digital package. It's a compressed archive that can hold lots of files and folders all in one place. It's a super convenient way to group and download many files at once. Many of our tools can even read the files directly from a ZIP you upload!::zip file,archive,what is,compressed,multiple files,package,unzip
What are the system requirements?::You're likely all set! All you need is a modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari. No other software installations are needed. Performance will just depend on how powerful your computer or phone is.::requirements,system,software,browser,compatibility,chrome,firefox,edge,safari,what do i need
How do I get the result?::Once a tool has worked its magic on your file(s), a 'Download' or 'Save' button will pop up. Just click that, and the finished file will be saved to your computer's default download folder. Easy as that!::download,result,output,save,get file,processed file,where is my file

Audio Editor (audio-trim.html)

How do I use the Audio Editor?::First, load your audio file using the 'Choose Audio File' button. Use the player to listen and find the parts you want to edit. You can set markers to define segments for deletion (red) or for keeping (green). Once you've set your edits, just hit the process button to get your final audio file!::audio editor,help,guide,start,how to,trim,cut,edit audio
What is the difference between Markers and Manual Regions in the audio tool?::Great question! Markers are visual and quick: you play the audio to a spot and click 'Set Start' or 'Set End'. It's perfect for trimming on the fly. Manual Regions are for precision: you type in the exact timestamps (like "0:10.5"). Use this when you know the exact times you need to edit.::markers vs regions,difference,audio editor,manual,visual,precise,when to use
How do I set a start or end marker in the audio editor?::It's easy! Play the audio or drag the progress bar to the exact moment you want to mark. Then, just click the 'Set Start' button to mark the beginning of your selection, and 'Set End' to mark where it finishes.::set start,end marker,audio,trim,cut,mark point,define segment,select part
What does 'Tag as Delete Segment (Red)' mean in the audio tool?::Think of red as "remove." This option marks the segment you've defined with your Start/End markers for deletion. When you process the audio in 'Delete Red Segments' mode, all the parts you marked in red will be neatly cut out, leaving you with the rest.::tag as delete,red,audio editor,remove,cut,delete segment,remove part,snip
What does 'Tag as Keep Segment (Green)' mean in the audio editor?::Think of green as "go" or "save." This tags your Start/End selection as a part you want to keep. When you process in 'Keep Green Segments' mode, only the green parts will be saved in the final audio. Everything else gets discarded. It's great for isolating a specific clip.::tag as keep,green,audio editor,isolate,save,extract,keep part,export clip
How can I change the skip time in the audio player?::Want to jump around faster or slower? Click the little gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) next to the playback controls. A box will pop up where you can type in the number of seconds you want the ‚è™ and ‚è© buttons to jump.::skip time,rewind,forward,audio settings,gear icon,jump,seek,playback speed
What is the 'Abstract Wave Container'?::It's a simple, visual timeline of your audio. It shows you where the playhead is and displays the red (delete) and green (keep) segments you've marked. It's a handy way to see a map of all your edits at a glance.::abstract wave,waveform,audio editor,visual,timeline,overview,edit map
How do I add a note in the audio editor?::Head over to the 'Notes' tab. Type your note in the box, find the right spot in the audio using the player, and then click 'Add Note @ Current Time'. Your note will be saved with a clickable timestamp, so you can jump right back to that moment later.::audio editor notes,timestamp,comment,add note,annotate,leave a comment
Can I edit a note I've already added?::Of course! In the 'Notes' tab, just find the note in your list and click the little pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è) next to it. A prompt will appear, and you can change the text of your note right there.::edit note,change comment,audio,modify,update note,fix typo
How do I process the audio file after setting markers?::You're at the final step! In the 'Markers' tab, choose the 'Processing Mode' you want (either deleting the red parts or keeping only the green ones). Then, click the big 'Process Using Markers' button. A new section will appear with your freshly edited audio, ready to be played or downloaded.::process audio,markers,apply changes,download,export,finish,render,get result
The 'Set End Marker' button is not working.::That's a common one! The 'Set End Marker' button is waiting for you to set a 'Start Marker' first. You have to tell it where to start before you can tell it where to end. Click 'Set Start', and the 'Set End' button should light up for you.::set end marker,disabled,not working,button grayed out,audio editor,cannot click
How can I listen to the edited audio before downloading?::Absolutely, you should always preview your work! After you click one of the 'Process' buttons, a 'Download Processed Audio' area will appear. It includes a brand new audio player where you can listen to the final, edited version to make sure it's perfect before you download.::preview edited audio,listen before download,check result,final audio,playback,test

Base64 Encoder / Decoder (base64.html)

How to use the Base64 tool?::It's super simple! To encode, just type or paste regular text into the 'Decoded' box, and the Base64 version will instantly appear in the 'Encoded' box. To decode, do the opposite: paste Base64 text into the 'Encoded' box. You can also load a file to encode it into a Base64 data URL.::base64,encoder,decoder,help,guide,how to use,convert
What does the swap button do in the Base64 tool?::The swap button (‚ÜîÔ∏è) is a handy shortcut! It instantly flips the content between the 'Decoded' and 'Encoded' text boxes. It's useful if you want to immediately re-encode something you just decoded, or vice-versa.::swap button,base64,switch content,reverse,flip,invert
How do I encode a file to Base64?::Easy! Just click the 'Load File' button right above the 'Decoded' box and pick your file. The tool will do the heavy lifting, automatically reading the file and putting its full Base64 data URL representation into the 'Encoded' box.::encode file,base64,data url,load file,convert to base64,file to text
How do I decode a Base64 file and download it?::Paste the entire Base64 data URL (it'll start with something like data:image/png;base64,...) into the 'Encoded' text area. The tool will recognize it and decode it. A 'Download' button will then appear, letting you save the original file back to your computer.::decode file,base64,download,save,data url,convert from base64,text to file
I see an error "Invalid Base64 string". What does it mean?::Uh oh. That error means the text you've put in the 'Encoded' box isn't a valid Base64 string. This usually happens if the text is incomplete, has extra characters that don't belong, or is corrupted. It's best to double-check the string you copied from its source.::error,invalid base64,string,corrupt,format,padding,wrong,not working,decoding error
What is a data URL?::A data URL is a clever way to embed a file (like an image or a PDF) directly into a document as a very long string of text. Our Base64 tool creates these for you when you load a file. They always start with data:[MIME_type];base64, which tells the browser what kind of file it is.::data url,scheme,what is,file embed,uri,inline file,data uri

Character Counter (Character-Counter.html)

What can the Character Counter tool do?::This tool is a text analysis powerhouse! It gives you all the basic stats like characters (with and without spaces), word count, unique words, sentences, and paragraphs. Plus, in the 'Advanced Tools' section, it can estimate reading time, calculate a reading level, and even show you the keyword density of your text.::character counter,word count,text analysis,features,stats,statistics
How is Reading Time calculated?::The reading time is a neat estimate based on the average reading speed of 225 words per minute (WPM). It's a general guideline to tell you roughly how long it might take someone to read your text.::reading time,calculation,words per minute,wpm,estimate,how long to read
What does Reading Level mean?::The Reading Level gives you an idea of how complex your text is. It's calculated using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula, which estimates the U.S. school grade needed to understand the text. For instance, a grade of 8 means an average eighth-grader could read it comfortably.::reading level,flesch kincaid,grade,formula,what is,comprehension,text difficulty
How do I convert text to UPPERCASE or Title Case?::Need to shout or be formal? Just paste your text in, then open the 'Advanced Tools & Analysis' section. You'll find handy buttons for 'UPPERCASE', 'lowercase', 'Title Case', and 'Sentence case'. One click and your text is instantly converted!::case converter,uppercase,lowercase,title case,sentence case,change case,transform text
What is Keyword Density?::Keyword Density is a cool feature for writers and SEO folks. You'll find it in the 'Advanced Tools'. It scans your text and shows a list of the most frequently used words (your keywords) and how many times each one appears. It's a great way to see what topics your text is focused on.::keyword density,analysis,seo,words,frequency,prominence,most used words
Can I load a text file for counting?::Yes, you can! Instead of pasting, just click the 'Load .txt File' button in the top-right. You can select a plain text file from your computer, and its contents will pop right into the text area, ready for analysis.::load txt file,import text,open file,text from file,upload txt
How do I copy my text?::Once you're done editing, just click the 'Copy Text' button located below the main text area. It will copy everything in the text box to your clipboard, ready to be pasted somewhere else.::copy text,button,clipboard,select all
What does the 'Clear' button do?::The 'Clear' button is for a fresh start. It will completely erase all the text from the input box. Don't worry, it will ask you for confirmation first, just in case you click it by accident!::clear text,delete,erase,remove,reset,start over

URL Encoder / Decoder (Url-encoder-decoder.html)

What does the URL Encoder do?::It makes your text safe to be part of a URL! The encoder converts a string by replacing special characters (like spaces, &, or ?) with their percent-encoded versions (for example, a space becomes %20). This is essential for making sure web addresses and data sent in them don't break.::url encoder,what is,percent encoding,uri,encodeURIComponent,special characters,url safe
How do I use the URL Encoder/Decoder?::It's a piece of cake. Type or paste your regular text into the 'Decoded' box to see the URL-safe version. Or, paste a messy, encoded URL string into the 'Encoded' box to see what it actually means. The conversion happens instantly as you type!::url encoder,decoder,help,guide,how to use,convert url
What is the difference between URL encoding and Base64 encoding?::They're for different jobs! URL encoding (or percent-encoding) is specifically for making strings safe to use inside a URL by only escaping a few special characters. Base64 encoding is for converting any kind of data (even files) into a plain text format. You wouldn't normally put a raw Base64 string in a URL path.::url vs base64,encoding,difference,percent encoding,comparison
Why is my encoded text red?::If the border of the 'Encoded' box turns red, it's a little warning. It means you've typed an invalid percent-encoded string that can't be decoded. This usually happens if you have a % that isn't followed by two proper hexadecimal characters (like G or Z).::red border,url decoder,error,invalid,malformed uri,percent sign,bad request
What is the swap button for in the URL tool?::The swap button (‚ÜîÔ∏è) is a time-saver that instantly switches the text between the 'Decoded' and 'Encoded' boxes. It's perfect for when you want to quickly re-work a string you just converted.::swap button,url,switch content,reverse,flip

All Image Tools (General Questions)

Can I process multiple images at once?::Yes, absolutely! All our image tools are built for batch processing. You can either select a whole group of image files or just choose a single ZIP archive packed with images. The tool will apply the same settings to every single one.::image tools,batch,multiple,zip archive,process,bulk,do many
How do I add more files after the first selection?::Loaded some images but forgot a few? No problem! After your first upload, a button like 'Add More Files' or 'Add More Files / ZIP' will appear. Just click that to add more images to your current batch.::add more files,images,zip,append,load more,add another
How do I select which images to process?::You're in complete control. In the file list, every image has a little checkbox next to its name. Just tick the boxes for the images you want to process and download. You can also use the 'Select All' and 'Deselect All' buttons to make it even faster.::select images,checkbox,process,which files,choose,pick which ones
Why is the 'Save' or 'Download' button disabled?::If the download button is grayed out, it just means you haven't told me which files to process yet! Please make sure at least one image has its checkbox ticked in the file list, and the button will become active.::save,download,button,disabled,grayed out,not working,cannot click
How do I remove an image from the list?::Added one by mistake? No worries. In the file list, each image has a little trash can icon (üóëÔ∏è) on the right. Just click that icon to remove that image from your current session.::remove image,delete file,list,trash can,discard,get rid of
How does the ZIP download work?::To make things easy for you, when you process multiple images, the tool automatically packages all the results into a single ZIP file for a one-click download. If you're only processing one image, it will download directly as a single file, no zipping needed.::zip download,multiple files,archive,how it works,package,bundle
My images are very large, is that a problem?::Working with very large, high-resolution images can be demanding on your computer, and since all the work is done on your device, it might cause your browser to slow down or even freeze. If you're working with a big batch of huge files, it's a good idea to resize them first if you can.::large images,high resolution,slow,performance,browser crash,memory,too big
Can I preview the final image before downloading?::Of course! All image tools have a live preview area. As you adjust the settings, the preview for the currently selected image will update in real-time. This way, you can see exactly what you're getting before you process the whole batch.::preview image,result,before download,live preview,see changes,check first
What does the fullscreen button do on the preview?::That button (usually in the top-right of the preview) is for getting a closer look! It opens the current preview image in a large, full-screen view so you can inspect the details of your edits. Just press 'Esc' or your browser's back button to exit.::fullscreen preview,expand,zoom image,larger view,inspect,see bigger

Image Chroma Key (image-chroma-key.html)

What is the Chroma Key tool for?::This is your green screen tool! The Chroma Key tool lets you remove a specific color from an image (like a green or blue background), making that area transparent. It's perfect for cutting out a subject so you can place them on a new, more exciting background.::chroma key,green screen,background remover,what is this for,blue screen,transparent background,remove color
How do I use the Chroma Key tool?::It's a simple three-step process! First, load your image. Second, use the color picker or the handy eyedropper tool to select the background color you want to zap. Third, adjust the 'Tolerance' and 'Edge Softness' sliders for a clean result. Then just pick an output format and save!::chroma key,guide,help,how to,remove color,background,get started
What is 'Tolerance' in the Chroma Key tool?::'Tolerance' tells the tool how picky to be. A low tolerance will only remove colors that are an exact match to your selection. A higher tolerance is more relaxed and will remove a wider range of similar shades and tones. You'll want to adjust this to get rid of the whole background without eating into your subject.::tolerance,chroma key,similarity,color range,threshold,sensitivity
How does the eyedropper tool work?::The eyedropper (üíß) is your best friend for accuracy. Click the icon, and your cursor will turn into a crosshair. Then, just click anywhere on the preview image to perfectly select the color of that exact pixel. It's the best way to get the right key color.::eyedropper,pick color from image,chroma key,color picker,sample color,select color
What does 'Edge Softness' do?::'Edge Softness' helps you avoid those ugly, jagged edges. It creates a smoother, slightly faded transition between your subject and the transparent background. A little bit of softness makes the final result look much more natural and professional.::edge softness,feathering,anti-aliasing,chroma key,smooth edge,blend
What does 'Invert Selection' do?::This flips the tool on its head! Normally, the tool removes the color you selected. But if you check 'Invert Selection', it does the opposite: it keeps only the color you selected and makes everything else transparent. It's a bit of a special effect!::invert selection,chroma key,keep color,remove everything else,reverse,opposite
Which output format should I choose for chroma keying?::Great question! You have to choose either PNG or WEBP. These are the only formats here that support transparency, which is what you need to save an image with the background actually removed. JPEG doesn't support transparency, so it won't be an option.::output format,transparency,png,webp,jpeg,alpha channel,which format
Why is the background of my saved image black or white instead of transparent?::This is a very common point of confusion! The tool did its job correctly. The black or white background you're seeing is just how some simple image viewers or file explorers display transparent areas. If you open your new PNG or WEBP file in a proper image editor or a web browser, you'll see the beautiful transparency you created.::transparent background,black,white,checkerboard,why,not working,problem

Image Collage Maker (image-collage-maker.html)

How do I make a collage?::Let's make some art! First, select all the images you want to feature. Next, choose a layout style: 'Vertical', 'Horizontal', or 'Grid'. Tweak the settings like spacing or background color, click 'Update Preview' to see how it looks, and then hit 'Generate & Download' to save your masterpiece!::collage maker,help,guide,start,how to,combine photos,photogrid
How can I reorder the images in my collage?::You're the director! In the file list, each image has up (üîº) and down (üîΩ) arrows. Just use those to move your images around. The order you see in the list is the exact order they'll appear in your final collage.::reorder images,change order,collage,arrange,sequence,move photos
What is the difference between 'Vertical Stitch' and 'Grid' layout?::'Vertical Stitch' is like taping photos together in one long column, which is awesome for things like long screenshots or comic strips. 'Grid' is the classic collage style, arranging your images neatly into rows and columns.::vertical stitch vs grid,collage,layout,difference,arrange,stack,columns
Can I add text between my images?::You sure can! When you're using the 'Vertical' or 'Horizontal' layout, just check the box for 'Add text between images'. A little text box will appear under each image in your file list, ready for your captions or comments.::add text between images,collage,stitch,caption,label,words
Why is the 'Update Preview' button important?::Making a collage, especially with big images, can take your computer a moment. The 'Update Preview' button is a time-saver. It quickly generates a low-resolution preview so you can check your layout and settings without waiting for the full, high-quality version to be created. It lets you experiment much faster!::update preview,button,collage,why use,refresh,see changes,draft
How do I make the background of my grid collage transparent?::For a cool, modern look, you can make the background transparent. In the 'Grid' options, just check the 'Transparent Background' box. This will make the spacing between your images transparent as well. Just remember to save as a PNG or WEBP to keep that transparency!::transparent background,grid collage,spacing,png,webp,no background
The preview is taking a long time to generate.::That can happen, especially if you're using a lot of large, high-resolution images. Your computer is doing all the hard work right here in the browser. The tool even gives a little performance warning for more than 15 images. Patience is key with big projects!::collage,slow,loading,performance warning,preview,lag,taking forever
How can I see a bigger version of the preview?::Need to check the details? After you click 'Update Preview', the 'Fullscreen' button will become active. Click it to get a big, beautiful view of your collage preview, perfect for inspecting the finer points.::fullscreen preview,collage maker,view bigger,zoom,inspect

Image Compressor (image-compressor.html)

How do I compress an image?::Let's shrink those files! First, load one or more images. Use the main 'Quality' slider to pick your compression level‚Äîlower numbers mean smaller files but also lower quality. For even more control, pop open the 'Advanced Options'. When you're happy with the preview, click 'Save'!::compress image,reduce file size,guide,help,shrink,optimize,make smaller
What do the quality levels like 'Medium' and 'High' mean?::They're just quick presets for the JPEG quality. 'High' (around 80%) keeps the image looking great but the file is bigger. 'Medium' (around 60%) is a great balance of size and quality. 'Low' will give you the smallest possible file, but you might notice some blurriness.::quality levels,compressor,meaning,medium,high,low,jpeg,presets
What is the difference between the basic slider and Advanced Options?::The basic slider is for quick, simple quality adjustments. The 'Advanced Options' panel is where the real power is! There, you can resize the image to a specific width or, even better, tell the tool to aim for a maximum file size in KB, which is perfect for web uploads.::basic slider vs advanced,options,compressor,difference,resize,target size,more control
How does the 'Max Size (KB)' setting work?::This feature is a lifesaver! You enter a target file size in kilobytes (KB), and the tool will automatically adjust the compression quality over and over until the image's file size is at or just below your target. It's the best way to meet those pesky "file must be under 500KB" upload limits.::max size,target,kb,kilobyte,compressor,how it works,file size limit,specific size
Can I rename the compressed files?::Yes, you can! In the 'Advanced Options', you'll find a 'Rename' box. You can create a pattern for your new files. For example, typing {name}-compressed will take your original file photo.jpg and save it as photo-compressed.jpg. The {name} part is a placeholder for the original name.::rename,compressed files,pattern,placeholder,output name,file naming
How can I see the before and after results?::The tool makes it easy to see your savings. When you select an image and adjust the settings, the preview shows the compressed 'after' version. Right below the preview, you'll see two boxes with stats for the 'Original' and 'Compressed' versions, including file size and dimensions, so you can compare them side-by-side.::before and after,compression,stats,compare,original,result,savings
Why does the output format only seem to be JPEG?::This specific tool is a 'lossy' compressor, which means it's designed to make file sizes dramatically smaller by cleverly throwing away a little bit of image data. The JPEG format is the world standard for this job and does it incredibly well. For converting to other formats without this type of compression, the 'Image Converter' tool is your best bet!::jpeg only,jpg,compressor,why,format,lossy,only jpeg

Image Converter (image-converter.html)

What is the Image Converter for?::This tool is your go-to for changing image formats. You can easily convert a PNG to a JPG, a WEBP to a PNG, or almost any other combination. It also has some handy advanced options, like adding a background color to transparent images during conversion.::image converter,what is it for,purpose,change format,convert,filetype
How do I convert an image?::It's a breeze! Load up one or more images. In the 'Options' section, click the 'Output Format' dropdown and choose the format you want to convert to (like PNG, JPG, WEBP, etc.). Then, just click 'Convert & Download' and you're done!::convert image,guide,help,how to,change format
What's the difference between PNG, JPG, and WEBP?::Here's a quick rundown: JPG is best for photos because it makes small files (but it's 'lossy', meaning a tiny bit of quality is lost). PNG is 'lossless' and supports transparency, making it perfect for logos, icons, and graphics. WEBP is the modern hero, offering excellent quality at even smaller file sizes than JPG and PNG, and it supports transparency too!::png vs jpg vs webp,difference,format,comparison,image type,use cases
What does 'Keep transparent' mean?::If your original image has a transparent background (like many PNG files do), checking this box tells the tool to preserve that transparency in the new file. This only works if your chosen output format, like PNG or WEBP, also supports transparency. If you uncheck it, you can add a solid background color instead.::keep transparent,background,converter,what is,alpha channel,transparency
How do I convert a transparent PNG to a JPG with a white background?::That's a very common task! Load your PNG file. Choose 'JPEG' as the 'Output Format'. Then, open the 'Advanced Options', UNCHECK the 'Keep transparent' box, and use the color picker to set the 'BG Color' to white (#FFFFFF). Hit convert, and you'll have your JPG on a solid white background.::png to jpg,white background,convert,transparent,how to,add background
How can I convert one image to multiple formats at once?::Want to be extra efficient? Open the 'Advanced Options'. You'll see a section called 'Convert to multiple formats'. Just check the boxes for all the formats you want (e.g., check both PNG and JPG). When you process the file, you'll get a neat ZIP archive containing your image in all the formats you selected.::convert multiple formats,at once,batch format,all formats,export all
How do I use the slideshow buttons?::When you've loaded multiple files, you'll see 'Prev File' and 'Next File' buttons below the preview. Use these to easily cycle through all your loaded images. This lets you preview how the conversion settings will affect each individual image before you commit to processing the whole batch.::slideshow buttons,preview,next,previous image,cycle,navigate images

Image Crop (image-crop.html)

What is the Image Cropper for?::This tool is for trimming your images to perfection. You can use it to crop an image to a specific shape, like a square or a widescreen rectangle, or define a totally custom size. Best of all, you can apply the same crop to a whole batch of images at once.::image cropper,what is it for,purpose,crop,resize,cut image,trim
How do I crop an image?::It's super intuitive. Load your image(s). Click on a preset aspect ratio from the choices at the top (like 'Square 1:1' or 'Widescreen 16:9'). The preview will instantly show you how the crop box fits on your image. Adjust if you need to, then click 'Crop & Download'.::crop image,guide,help,how to,aspect ratio,select area
How do I set a custom aspect ratio?::If our presets aren't quite right, you can make your own! Open the 'Advanced Crop Options'. In the 'Custom Ratio' section, just type in the width and height numbers for the ratio you need. For example, putting W: 8 and H: 10 will give you a perfect 8x10 crop.::custom aspect ratio,crop image,define ratio,manual,own size
What is the difference between cropping and 'Fit to ratio'?::This is a key difference! Cropping physically cuts parts of your image away to make it fit the new shape, which means you might lose some of the top/bottom or sides. 'Fit to ratio (no crop)' is gentler; it resizes your entire image to fit inside the new shape and fills any empty space with colored bars. This way, you never lose any part of the original picture.::crop vs fit to ratio,difference,resize,no crop,padding,letterbox,scale
How do I change the background color when using 'Fit to ratio'?::When you have 'Fit to ratio (no crop)' checked, a 'BG Color' option will appear in the advanced settings. Just use the color picker to choose the color for the bars that will be added to the sides or top/bottom of your image.::fit to ratio,background color,padding,change,bars,letterbox color
Can I make the background transparent when using 'Fit to ratio'?::Yes, you can! With 'Fit to ratio' enabled, just check the 'Keep transparent' box in the advanced settings. The bars added to fill the space will be transparent instead of a solid color. You'll need to save as a PNG or WEBP to keep the transparency.::fit to ratio,transparent background,no crop,padding,png,webp,alpha
Can I preview the original image without the crop?::Absolutely. In the file list, each image has a little eye icon (üëÅÔ∏è). Clicking this will pop open a fullscreen preview of the original, un-cropped image, so you can easily compare it to your cropped version.::preview original image,crop,uncropped,view,source,see original

Image Rotate & Flip (image-rotate-flip.html)

How do I rotate an image?::Let's get that picture straight! Load your image(s). You can use the quick buttons ('90¬∞ Left', '90¬∞ Right', '180¬∞') for common rotations, or for total control, type any angle you want into the 'Rotation Angle' input box. The preview shows you the result instantly.::rotate image,flip,help,guide,turn,orientation,straighten
How can I flip an image?::It's like looking in a mirror! Use the 'Flip H' button to flip the image horizontally (a mirror image) and 'Flip V' to flip it vertically (upside down). You can even combine flips with rotations for any orientation you can imagine.::flip image,horizontal,vertical,mirror,upside down,reflect
What is the 'Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence'?::This is a super powerful feature for when you need lots of versions of an image. It lets you automatically create multiple rotated copies of each selected photo. For instance, you could tell it to rotate each image from 0¬∞ to 360¬∞ in 10¬∞ steps, which would instantly generate 36 different images for each photo you upload!::advanced batch rotation,sequence,what is,multiple rotations,generate,series,step rotation
How many images will the advanced sequence create?::The tool will do the math for you. In the advanced options panel, it shows an 'Estimated images per input file' count. This tells you exactly how many rotated versions will be made for each photo you've selected. So if it says 36, and you've selected 2 photos, you'll get 72 files in total.::how many images,advanced rotation,sequence,count,output,total files
Why would I use the advanced sequence?::It's a niche but very cool feature! It's great for creating frames for a stop-motion animation (like a spinning logo), generating lots of slightly different images for a machine learning dataset (data augmentation), or just creating cool artistic effects.::why use,advanced rotation,sequence,purpose,animation,data augmentation,machine learning,art
What does the 'Rename file' option do?::This helps you keep your output files organized. You can set a base name, and the tool will automatically add suffixes to tell you what was done. For example, it might add _rot_90 for a 90-degree rotation or _fh for a horizontal flip, so you can easily tell them apart.::rename file,rotate,flip,suffix,output name,naming convention

Image Splitter (image-split.html)

What does the Image Splitter do?::This tool acts like a pair of digital scissors. It lets you cut a single image into multiple smaller pieces, like tiles in a grid. You can split it into a simple 2x2 or 3x3 grid for social media, or create a custom grid with any number of rows and columns you want.::image splitter,split,grid,pieces,what is,cut,divide,slice,tiles
How do I split an image into a 3x3 grid?::Perfect for Instagram! Just load your image. In 'Simple Mode', click the '3x3' template button. You'll see the grid lines appear on your image in the preview. Then, just click 'Save' to download a ZIP file containing all 9 individual pieces.::split image,3x3,grid,how to,template,instagram grid
What is the difference between 'Simple Mode' and 'Advanced Mode'?::'Simple Mode' is for speed. It gives you one-click templates for the most common grid sizes, like 2x2 and 3x3. 'Advanced Mode' gives you complete control, letting you specify the exact number of rows and columns for a totally custom grid.::simple vs advanced mode,image splitter,difference,custom,template,grid size
Can I split an image into individual pixels?::Technically, yes! In 'Advanced Mode', you can check the 'Split into single pixels' box. But please be very careful! This will try to create one image file for every single pixel in your photo. For a normal photo, that could be millions of files and will almost certainly crash your browser. It's a fun experiment, but only for tiny images!::split into pixels,single pixel,image splitter,warning,crash,performance,caution
How do I add spacing or a border between the split pieces?::You can do that! Use the 'Border/Spacing Width' input to set a size in pixels. Then, use the 'Border/Spacing Color' picker to choose a color. This will add that border around each individual tile when it's saved. If you don't want any border, just set the width to 0.::border,spacing,image splitter,gap,color,margin,padding
How are the split images named?::You can create your own naming system using the 'Filename Pattern' box. It uses placeholders like {name} for the original filename, {row} for the row number, and {col} for the column number. The default pattern, {name}_r{row}_c{col}.{ext}, is a great way to keep everything organized.::filename pattern,image splitter,naming convention,placeholders,rename,output name
How many files will be created?::The math is simple: it's the number of rows multiplied by the number of columns. The tool will show you a "Total Pieces" count in the preview area, so you'll know exactly how many files to expect in your downloaded ZIP archive. A 3x3 split will always give you 9 files.::how many files,image splitter,total pieces,count,output,number of files

Image Watermarker (image-watermark.html)

What is watermarking?::Watermarking is like signing your digital artwork. It's the process of overlaying a semi-transparent logo or line of text onto an image. Photographers and artists use it all the time to protect their work from being used without permission and to promote their brand.::watermark,what is it for,copyright,protection,brand,logo,signature
How do I add a text watermark?::Easy! Select the 'Text' watermark type. Type your copyright or name into the 'Text' input field. Then, you can use the sliders and color pickers to customize the size, color, transparency, and position of your text. You'll see all your changes live in the preview.::text watermark,how to add,guide,add text,overlay,copyright text
How do I use my own logo as a watermark?::That's the professional touch! Select the 'Image' watermark type. Click 'Choose Watermark Image' and select your logo file from your computer. PNG files with transparent backgrounds work best for this. After that, you can control its size, opacity, and where it sits on your main image.::image watermark,logo,how to add,overlay image,picture on picture,add logo
What is the difference between 'Text', 'Image', and 'Both' modes?::They let you choose your weapon! 'Text' mode is for a simple text-only watermark. 'Image' mode is for using a logo or another image as your watermark. And 'Both' mode lets you do both at the same time, so you can have your logo and your name on the image together.::text vs image vs both,watermark,difference,modes,types
What does 'Tile Watermark' do?::The 'Tile Watermark' option is for maximum security. You'll find it in the 'Advanced Options'. It takes your watermark and repeats it in a pattern across the entire image. This makes it almost impossible for someone to just crop out your signature, providing much stronger protection.::tile watermark,repeat,pattern,across image,what is,security,full image
How do I change the position of the watermark?::You have two ways. For quick placement, use the 9-position grid to snap your watermark to a corner, an edge, or the center. For fine-tuning, open the 'Advanced Options' and play with the 'Offset' X and Y values. These let you nudge the watermark pixel by pixel from its starting position.::position watermark,offset,move,placement,grid,alignment,nudge
Can I change the font of the text watermark?::Of course! In the 'Advanced Options', look for 'Text Styling'. You'll find a 'Font Family' dropdown menu with several common fonts to choose from. You can also make your text bold or italic to make it stand out.::change font,text watermark,style,font family,bold,italic,font type
My watermark image is a different shape. What is 'Maintain Aspect Ratio'?::This is a very important setting! It's in the advanced image options. Keeping this checked ensures that your logo is never stretched or squished when you resize it. It will always keep its original, proper shape. I highly recommend leaving this turned on!::maintain aspect ratio,watermark,image,logo,stretch,squish,proportions,distort

Image to PDF (image-to-pdf.html)

How do I convert images to a PDF?::Let's build your PDF! First, load all the images you want to include. Next, drag and drop them in the staging area to get them in the perfect order. Adjust the page settings like paper size and orientation. When it all looks good, just click 'Generate PDF'.::image to pdf,convert,jpg to pdf,how to,guide,create pdf from images
How do I reorder the images?::You're in the driver's seat. In the 'Image Staging Area', just click and drag any image thumbnail and drop it into its new spot. If you're on a phone, use the little up and down arrows on each image. The order you create in this list becomes the page order in your final PDF.::reorder images,pdf pages,drag and drop,change order,sequence,move up,move down
What does 'Page Size: Original Image Ratio' mean?::This is a fantastic setting for preserving the look of your photos. It tells the tool to create a custom PDF page for each image, where the page size and shape perfectly match the image itself. This means no weird white borders or cropping‚Äîwhat you see is what you get.::page size,original image ratio,what is,dimensions,no border,perfect fit
What is the difference between 'Fit Page' and 'Stretch to Fill'?::'Fit Page' is usually the best choice. It makes your image as large as possible on the page without distorting it, which might leave some white margins. 'Stretch to Fill' is more aggressive; it will warp and stretch your image to cover every inch of the page, which can make things look squished.::fit page vs stretch to fill,difference,scaling,aspect ratio,distort,margins
Can I add page numbers to the PDF?::Yes, you can! Just open the 'Advanced Options' and check the 'Add Page Numbers' box. You'll then get more options to customize the position, font, and format of the numbers (like 'Page 1' or '1 / 10').::add page numbers,pdf,how to,footer,header,numbering
How do I set the PDF title or author?::To add that professional touch, open the 'Advanced Options'. You'll find fields where you can type in the 'Title', 'Author', and 'Subject' for your document. This information gets embedded in the PDF's metadata, which you can see in the file properties in any PDF reader.::pdf metadata,title,author,subject,properties,document info
The generated PDF is larger than my original images combined. Why?::That can definitely happen, and it's a bit weird, I know. A PDF isn't just a bucket for images; it's a complex document format with its own structure for fonts, links, and metadata, all of which adds a little overhead. Sometimes, the way images are embedded can also cause the size to increase. For smaller PDFs, try compressing the images first!::pdf bigger than images,larger file size,why,overhead,increase size,pdf size issue

PDF Compressor (pdf-compressor.html)

How do I compress a PDF?::Let's make that PDF smaller! Load one or more PDF files. Choose a compression level like 'Balanced' or 'Smaller Size'. You can adjust settings for each file individually or use the 'Apply to All' option to make it quick. When you're ready, just click 'Compress'!::compress pdf,reduce size,guide,help,shrink,optimize,make pdf smaller
What is the difference between the quality presets?::The presets are all about balancing size versus quality. 'Good Quality' keeps the images inside your PDF looking sharp, but the file size will be larger. 'Extreme' compression will make the file tiny, but images might look blurry. 'Balanced' is a great middle-ground to start with.::quality presets,compressor,difference,dpi,resolution,levels,image quality
Can I set different compression settings for each PDF?::Yes, you have that fine-grained control. Open the 'Advanced Settings' panel and make sure the 'Apply these settings to all selected files' box is UNCHECKED. Now, you can click on any file in your list, and the settings you choose will apply only to that specific PDF. It will even get a little 'Custom' badge.::different settings per file,pdf compressor,custom,individual,batch,per file
How does the compression work?::Here's the magic behind it: this tool essentially re-creates your PDF. It takes each page, turns it into an image at a lower resolution (DPI) and quality, and then builds a brand new PDF from those smaller images. This drastically cuts the file size, but it does mean that any text in the original becomes part of an image.::how pdf compression works,re-render,rasterize,dpi,quality,flatten,technical
What does DPI mean?::DPI stands for 'Dots Per Inch', and it's a measure of resolution or sharpness. A high DPI (like 300) is for high-quality printing and makes for large files. A lower DPI (like 96 or 72) is perfect for viewing on a screen and results in a much, much smaller file size.::dpi,what is,dots per inch,resolution,quality,sharpness
Will this make my PDF text unsearchable?::Yes, in most cases, it will. Because the compression process turns each page into a flat image, any selectable text from your original PDF gets 'baked' into that image. This means you won't be able to search, select, or copy the text from the compressed version.::searchable text,selectable,copy,ocr,rasterize,flatten,unsearchable,text selection
Why would I use the 'Grayscale' option?::That's a great way to save even more space! Color information takes up a lot of data. By converting everything to grayscale (black and white), you can significantly reduce the file size. It's the perfect option if the color in your document isn't important.::grayscale,black and white,compress pdf,why use,reduce size,no color

PDF Merger (pdf-merger.html)

How do I merge multiple PDFs into one?::Let's bring those documents together! Load up all the PDF files you want to combine. In the list, just drag and drop the files to get them in the perfect order. Once you're happy with the sequence, click the 'Merge to PDF' button, and they'll become a single file.::merge pdf,combine,join,guide,how to,unite,put together
How do I reorder the PDF files?::You're the editor! In the file list, just click and hold on a file (or its little drag-handle icon) and drag it up or down to its new position. If you're on a mobile device, use the handy up and down arrow buttons on each file to reorder them.::reorder pdf,files,drag and drop,change order,sequence,move file
Can I merge only specific pages from a PDF?::Absolutely! This is a powerful feature. For each file in your list, you'll see a 'Pages' input box. You can tell it exactly which pages to grab. For example, typing 1-3, 5 will take only pages 1, 2, 3, and 5 from that PDF and add them to the final document.::merge specific pages,range,select,part of pdf,extract,page range
What does 'Password Protected' mean on a file?::That label means the PDF file is locked and requires a password to open. Unfortunately, this tool can't process password-protected files, so it will have to skip that one. You'll need to remove the password using a different tool before you can merge it.::password protected,pdf,encrypted,error,cannot process,locked,skipped
What is the total page count displayed?::That's your final document summary. The 'Total pages to process' number shows you exactly how many pages will be in your new, merged PDF based on the files and page ranges you've selected. It updates in real-time as you make changes.::total page count,what is it,pdf merger,summary,number of pages,final count
Can I add page numbers to the final merged PDF?::Yes! To help readers keep their place, just check the 'Add page numbers to merged PDF' box. This will automatically put a simple 'Page X / Y' number at the bottom of every page in your newly created PDF.::add page numbers,merged pdf,how to,footer,page count
How do I set the Title or Author for the new PDF?::To add that professional metadata, just open the 'Advanced Options' section. You'll find input fields for 'PDF Title' and 'PDF Author'. Whatever you type there will be saved into the properties of the final PDF file.::pdf metadata,title,author,merge,set,properties,document info

PDF Page Deleter (pdf-page-deleter.html)

How do I delete pages from a PDF?::Let's do some spring cleaning! Load your PDF. In the 'Pages to delete' box, just type the page numbers you want to get rid of. You can list single pages (like 3), ranges (like 5-8), or mix them up (like 2, 5-8, 11-end). The preview will tell you how many pages are left. Then, just click 'Delete Pages & Save'!::delete pdf pages,remove,how to,guide,cut pages,get rid of pages
How can I preview which pages I am deleting?::You can double-check your work! Use the page navigation buttons below the preview to flip through your PDF. If you land on a page that's in your deletion list, a big "Marked for Deletion" message will appear over it, so you know for sure it's on the chopping block.::preview deleted pages,marked for deletion,overlay,check,confirm,verify
What does -end mean in the page range?::-end is a handy shortcut! It means "all the way to the last page." So, if you type 10-end, the tool will delete page 10 and every single page that comes after it, right up to the very end of the document.::end keyword,page range,last page,until the end,to the end
Why can't I delete all the pages?::A PDF with zero pages isn't really a PDF anymore! The tool prevents you from deleting every single page because a valid PDF document has to contain at least one. If you want to get rid of the whole file, you can just delete it from your computer.::cannot delete all pages,why,pdf,at least one,error,must have one page
How is this different from the PDF Page Extractor?::Good question, they're two sides of the same coin! The Deleter removes the pages you list. The Extractor keeps the pages you list. So, to get just page 5 from a 10-page PDF, it's much easier to extract page 5 than it is to delete pages 1-4 and 6-10.::deleter vs extractor,difference,pdf tools,remove vs keep,comparison
Can I change the name of the output file?::You sure can. Before you save, you'll see an 'Output Filename' box that's pre-filled with a suggestion (like original-name_deleted.pdf). You can click in that box and type any name you want for your new, shorter PDF.::output filename,change name,save as,rename,new name

PDF Page Extractor (pdf-page-extract.html)

What is the PDF Page Extractor for?::This tool lets you cherry-pick the best pages from a PDF. You can select specific pages or ranges from a large document and save just those pages as a new, smaller PDF. It's perfect for when your boss sends you a 100-page report but you only need the two pages with your name on them!::pdf page extractor,what is it for,purpose,pull out,keep pages,select pages,isolate
How do I extract pages from a PDF?::It's as easy as 1-2-3. Load your PDF. In the 'Pages to extract' box, type in the numbers of the pages you want to keep (for example, 2, 5-8, 10). The tool will tell you how many pages that is. Then just click 'Extract Pages & Save' to get your new, streamlined PDF.::extract pdf pages,keep,save,how to,guide,select pages,pull out
How can I see which pages will be kept?::You can check before you commit! Use the page navigation to look at any page in the original PDF. If that page is on your 'keep' list, you'll see a "Marked for Extraction" overlay on the preview. This confirms it will be included in your new document.::preview extracted pages,marked for extraction,overlay,check,confirm,verify
What is the difference between the Extractor and the Deleter tool?::They're opposites! The Extractor keeps only the pages you specify. The Deleter removes the pages you specify. It's usually easier to use the Extractor if you want to keep just a few pages, and the Deleter if you want to remove just a few pages.::extractor vs deleter,difference,pdf tools,keep vs remove,comparison
What does the result preview text mean?::That little line of text is a quick confirmation for you. It summarizes what's about to happen, like "This will create a new PDF with 3 page(s)". It's a good way to be sure that your page range was understood correctly before you save the file.::result preview text,what does it mean,extractor,summary,confirmation
Is the quality of the extracted pages affected?::Nope, not at all! The extractor acts like a photocopier, not a re-drawer. It copies the selected pages from the original PDF to the new one exactly as they are, without any re-compression or changes. The quality will be identical to the original.::quality,extracted pages,affect,change,pdf,lossless,same quality

PDF Splitter (pdf-splitter.html)

What can the PDF Splitter tool do?::This tool is a document powerhouse! It can break up a single PDF into multiple smaller ones in several ways. You can extract a custom set of pages into one new PDF, split the document by ranges into several PDFs, break it into fixed-size chunks (like every 2 pages), or even give every single page its own PDF file.::pdf splitter,what can it do,features,modes,divide,break up,separate
What's the difference between 'Extract pages' and 'Split by custom ranges'?::This is a key distinction! 'Extract pages' takes all the pages you list (like 1, 3, 5) and bundles them together into one single new PDF. 'Split by custom ranges' (like 1-2, 3-5) creates multiple new PDFs‚Äîone PDF containing pages 1-2, and a second PDF containing pages 3-5.::extract vs split custom ranges,difference,one file,multiple files,single vs multiple
How do I split a PDF every 3 pages?::That's a common one! Just select the 'Split into fixed-page files' mode. An input box will appear. Type the number 3 in that box. The tool will then go through your PDF and create a new PDF for pages 1-3, another for 4-6, and so on, until it's done.::split every 3 pages,fixed page files,how to,chunks,by number,groups
How does the preview work for the splitter?::The preview shows your original PDF page with a visual guide overlaid on top. It draws grid lines to show you how the split will happen. For example, in the 3x3 simple split, it will draw a grid over the page. This is just a visual aid to help you imagine the final result. The actual split is done page by page.::preview splitter,grid lines,visualize,guide,overlay
How are the new files named?::To keep you organized, you can set a 'Filename Pattern'. Use handy placeholders like {pdf_name} for the original name, and {page_num} or {range_num} to automatically number your split files. This makes it super easy to find the file you need later!::filename pattern,naming convention,placeholders,rename,output name,split files
